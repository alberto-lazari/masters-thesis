Many have supported me along the path to this achievement.
I would like to state my deepest gratitude to each one of them,
although I know that words alone will never enough to express it completely.
I hope someday I can return this kindness.
In the meantime, let me try the best I can do through these black letters on a white page.

To professor Losiouk,
for inspiring my interest in a new field and supervising the long process that led to this work with admirable patience and care.

To everyone at Corollario, for their warm welcome into a new adventure.
Although it has been a short experience up until now,
it filled the last days of my degree with inspiring harmony.

To everyone within the scouting world I had the privilege of meeting.
So many embodied living examples of the kind of Christian, citizen, and man I aspire to become.

To my closest friends,
that I can always trust to be there for supporting and encouraging me.
I am lucky to have their constant belief in me and my capabilities,
even more than I have in myself.

To my family, that, no matter what, is always fully supporting my choices with their love and care.
To my parents, for trusting my decisions and always guiding me toward my achievements.
To my sister Anna, that always manages to bring a smile to my face and makes me proud of her achievements.
To my brother Francesco, that always has been a great inspiration in so many aspects of my life.

To each one who brightened my days in Pauda.
They are too many to list them all,
but each should know they share a special place in my heart.
Without them, I would not have come this far---and this is not a formality, I truly mean it.
The excitement of small fun projects,
the unnecessary knowledge shared during lunches,
the support in overcoming exams,
the bonds that last far beyond lectures and the narrow borders of Padua and Italy.
These are just a handful of reasons that made me appreciate my time at university and this field of study,
and that ultimately brought me here,
to the end of this incredible journey.
